*Figure 1: The ReStraV method. Video frames are processed by a self-supervised encoder (DINOv2) to get embeddings. In this representation space, natural videos trace "straighter" paths than AI-generated ones. The trajectory's geometry, especially its curvature, serves as a powerful signal for a lightweight classifier to distinguish real from fake.*

## üöÄ Overview

**ReStraV** for detecting AI-generated videos. The core idea is inspired by the **"perceptual straightening" hypothesis**, which suggests that natural videos trace straighter paths in a neural network's representation space compared to synthetic ones.

We leverage a pre-trained vision model to extract frame embeddings and geometrical trajectory such us **perceptual curvature** and **stepwise distance** of a video's trajectory in this representation space. Our findings show that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns. A lightweight classifier trained on these geometric features achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency.
